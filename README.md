#  Project Overview
This is my first project as astudent of DSA incubator hub,it is a  Gender Equality Audit for Palmoria Group
Client: Palmoria Group
Location: Nigeria (Operations across 3 regions)
Project Lead: Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe (CHRO)
HR Analytics Consultant: [P.A (myself)]
Based on the data anlysed ,key findings were made and recommendations were given.

#   Steps :
Various steps were taken  to analyse this data and include the following

#   Data Sources and Data base
The primary source of data is  Palmoria group bonur rules 1 and Palmoria group emb(XLS sheet) data an open-source file that can be easily Acex.data base is titled:"Peter Ajoms Data base "
'
#  Data Collection
This process involves the systematic gathering and measurement of information on various variables of interest. It includes downloading datasets from an open-source platform provided by DSA and efficiently importing them into a database using SQL Server. This approach ensures that the data is organized and accessible for analysis.

#  Data Manipulation
Data Manipulation focuses on transforming and preparing data into a useful format.

#   Data Integrity
Data Integrity focuses on the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data. It ensures that data remains unchanged during storage, transmission, and retrieval.

#  Data Presentation
Data Presentation is concerned with organizing data in a way that is easy to understand and interpret by using visuals like charts and graphs.

#  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This involves exploring data to unveil the answers behind the questions, such as;
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and
departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of
management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?
● Also visualize this by regions
Case Questions
5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee
data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the
performance rating. He handed you another data set that contains rules for making bonus
payments and asked you to:
● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of
bonus)
● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
#   Analysis
Gender Pay Gap Analysis (Overall)
Average Salary (Female): $75,028.76
Accounting department  has the lowest number of female
Average Salary (Male): c76,708.36

There is a gender pay gap of approximately $1,679.60, with males earning more on average.
In addition Palmoral Group does not meet up  with the minimum pay of employee as per regulation.



#    Recommendations
## Short-Term (0–12 months)
Implement unconscious bias training.

Review and revise all HR policies through a gender lens.

Ensure transparent promotion and recruitment processes.

## Medium-Term (1–2 years)
Set gender parity goals for all levels of the organization.

Launch sponsorship and mentorship programs for women and non-binary employees.

Introduce gender-disaggregated KPIs in performance reviews.

##  Long-Term (3–5 years)
Aim for gender-balanced leadership (50/50 target).

Cultivate an inclusive culture through continuous feedback loops.

Conduct biennial gender audits and integrate results into strategy.

## Conclusion
Palmora Group demonstrates a strong foundation for gender equity but requires a more strategic, data-driven approach to fully realize inclusivity goals. By addressing gaps in leadership, pay, policy, and culture, Palmora can establish itself as a leader in gender-responsive HR practices.
